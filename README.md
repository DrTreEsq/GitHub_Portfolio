### App Developer | Artificial Intelligence Engineer | Aerial Robotics and AstroPhysics revving up! 🚀 
###### Welcome, Earthling! My name is Trey and I am an educator and forever student with a goal of learning each valuable skill necessary to pioneer the change that I wish to see in the world.

# Projects in Progress
## 1) General Assembly Capstone: The Virtual Detention!
#### Summary: The Virtual Detention is an online classroom intended for students that tend to get bad reps in tradidional classrooms. Using Natural Language Question Answering BERT models trained with SQuAD, along with React and Node on the front end, students can interact with this platform to help study outside of normal school environments or hours.
#### Toolkit: Tensorflow, python, Docker, Heroku, etc.
