          <h4 className="black"> The Web Scraper is made with Scrapy in Python and the data is saved as json files.
                I am scraping Legal data from government websites such as pulling articles from the Constitution full text online.
                Now that the data has been parsed, I am focusing on deploying and automation with Azure PostgreSQL and GitHub Actions.
                In addition, looking for websites with surplus of data, rather than limited articles. In research phase continually.
                Considering other legal data to scrape that is better formatted and therefore better to parse through.
                SQL medical database also in progress, researching best sites to scrape and clean - stay tuned on progress!
