# Projects in Progress!
##### Welcome to the homepage(README) for this directory. I always have several projects going on at once as I have a complex learning style that comprises of tackling everything I need to know all at once!
###### But this can seem hectic sometimes, so organization is key! Go through some directories and files in this root directory to see some code's i've been working on. They are commented and tracked with a google sheets tracker so that I am able to keep track of progress on each one while taking on additional skills. No project left behind!

# Projects in Progress
## 1. General Assembly Capstone: The Virtual Detention!
#### Summary: The Virtual Detention is an online classroom intended for students that tend to get bad reps in tradidional classrooms. Using Natural Language Question Answering BERT models trained with SQuAD, along with React and Node on the front end, students can interact with this platform to help study outside of normal school environments or hours.

#### Toolkit: Tensorflow, python, Docker, Heroku, etc.
