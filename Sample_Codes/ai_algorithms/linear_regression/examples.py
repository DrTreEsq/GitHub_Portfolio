# ## 2 -  Problem Statement
# 
# Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
# - You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
# - The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
# - You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant. 
#     - For these cities, you have the city population.
#     
# Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?

# load the dataset
x_train, y_train = load_data()

# print x_train
print("Type of x_train:",type(x_train))
print("First five elements of x_train are:\n", x_train[:5]) 

# print y_train
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
print("First five elements of y_train are:\n", y_train[:5])  

# Please print the shape of `x_train` and `y_train` and see how many training examples you have in your dataset.


print ('The shape of x_train is:', x_train.shape)
print ('The shape of y_train is: ', y_train.shape)
print ('Number of training examples (m):', len(x_train))


# The city population array has 97 data points, and the monthly average profits also has 97 data points. These are NumPy 1D arrays.

# #### Visualize your data
# 
# It is often useful to understand the data by visualizing it. 
# - For this dataset, you can use a scatter plot to visualize the data, since it has only two properties to plot (profit and population). 
# - Many other problems that you will encounter in real life have more than two properties (for example, population, average household income, monthly profits, monthly sales).When you have more than two properties, you can still use a scatter plot to see the relationship between each pair of properties.
# 

# In[65]:


# Create a scatter plot of the data. To change the markers to red "x",
# we used the 'marker' and 'c' parameters
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r') 

# Set the title
plt.title("Profits vs. Population per city")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Profit in $10,000')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Population of City in 10,000s')
plt.show()


# Your goal is to build a linear regression model to fit this data.
# - With this model, you can then input a new city's population, and have the model estimate your restaurant's potential monthly profits for that city.
