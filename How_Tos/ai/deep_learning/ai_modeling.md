## Deep Learning in Machine Learning?

### Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning
#### Summary!
Not only is there math and computations that require intuition on choosing initial parameters like standard Machine Learning, but the engineer also has to choose the architecture of the neural network. This is happening because instead of giving what data to classify, the model has to choose which pieces of data to group together.
Which brings me to my point of training. Algorithms can't just be written, these models that are written then have to be trained and fine-tuned so that inferences can be made off of the data and we have full use of the ai! continue reading below to understand more about how this works...
